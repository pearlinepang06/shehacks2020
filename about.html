    <mark>Sustainability </mark>is collaborating across all industries, fields, socio-economic backgrounds, to implement long-lasting solutions that can support us all.
    <br>
    <br>
    Sustainability is truly about this commitment; the decision to change our mindsets across all areas of life.

    Sustainability is about taking responsibility for our actions.

<p>
  Sustainability is a commitment. It begins with acknowledging the limitations and strains being placed on our natural resources. It is strengthened by the awareness we raise as activists, to our friends, family, communities. But the next steps forward are to bring sustainability as a mindset, as a principle in all areas of life.

Industries run on energy - the only way to produce this energy is through the combustion of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels include oil, natural gas, and coal, and are all sources of once-living beings who lived thousands of years ago, and who's natural matter - made up of carbon just like you or me - was compressed over the thousands of years of sediment building on top. Because all of these sources were once living organisms, they are extremely rich in energy. All of these fossil fuels have greatly brought beneift into our lives and raised the standard of living for many. However, we are coming to the end of our ability to rely on fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are non-renewable, and the more we burn, the greater a toll it has on our environment yearly.

In discussing the many factors and elements of acvitism, we can begin to dissect the intersections of science, legislative change and social action; there, we can begin to pinpoint solutions to our climate crisis. Our scientists - experts in their field - have been warning us on the figures revealing deliberate human action correlating with increased global temperatures.
